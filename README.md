# 💅🏻 Pretty Gnome
This is a small script that will copy the original Yaru theme, and add some changes to it with custom css to make transparent windows.<br>
On top of that it will rewrite the ~/.config/gtk-4.0 and 3.0 gtk.css files to the corresponding theme you selected ( Black or White )<br>

# 🧩 Extensions
You will need [user-themes](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/)<br>
This theme was made with the [Blur My Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/) extension in mind, without it it wil look like crap.<br><br>

# 🚨 Warning
You need the original Yaru theme in the system ( Ubuntu works out of box )<br>
Sometimes the window managment buttons may look bad, i see this behaviour only for Chrome, but it's worth to mention.<br><br>

# 🤗 I recomend you to use BlackBox terminal ( it uses GTK-4.0 )
This theme makes the blackbox transparent as well.<br>
